        // The $(document).ready(function() {}) just says "Wait to run the code inside here until after everything we need on the HTML page has loaded." This is important because some of the code in here interacts with the HTML elements in the DOM. We want to make sure we don't try to render our gameBoard until all of the HTML DOM elements that it is supposed to render into are loaded.
        $(document).ready(function() {
          // NOTE: there are two separate things going on: you making a change to the javascript code/logic behind the app, and rendering that new "state" to the DOM (what appears on the screen). In order to see any changes you make rendered to the screen, we need to call renderGameBoard() and pass in the updated gameBoard as an argument. 
          renderGameBoard(gameBoard); // DON'T REMOVE THIS LINE. This line makes sure that any changes you make to your JS code will actually show up on the screen. Try commenting it out and see how the gameBoard is no longer rendered to the browser, even though your logic is clearly still running, as seen by your console.logs.
